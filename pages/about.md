Hello! My name is Sarah Miller. I'm a game developer who is graduating in Spring '21 from Kennesaw State University with a BS in Computer Game Design and Development along with a minor in both Computer Science and Software Engineering. In my free time, I like to birdwatch, program, and nap. My favorite games are Carcassonne, Magic: The Gathering, Animal Crossing, Shovel Knight, and Minecraft. I live in the metro Atlanta area and I'd love to make games with you, in-person or remotely!
