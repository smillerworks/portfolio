Hello! My name is Sarah Miller. I'm a game developer who is graduating in Spring '21 from Kennesaw State University with a BS in Computer Game Design and Development along with a minor in both Computer Science and Software Engineering. I live in the metro Atlanta area and I'd love to make games with you.
