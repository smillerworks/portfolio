I am the co-creator of Dead Engines, the project made by myself and my Studio partner Nick Horsma over the course of fall 2020 and spring 2021. Dead Engines is a game about human survivors living in an ancient war automaton, repairing its functionality, and battling against other war machines while uncovering secrets about humanity's dangerous past. I mainly worked on designing and implementing the game's inner systems as well as user interface. Some inner systems included the resource spawning algorithm and room coordination. Nick worked on enemy and unit AI, controls, 3D modeling, and 2D asset creation.

We created the game in Unity over the course of two semesters. We had to provide updates on our progress every other week in a group setting. The game is programmed entirely in C#.

The most challenging component of the project was definetely finding acceptable ways to manage the sheer amount of UI as well as the depth of our game's systems. I reworked major parts of the code multiple times in order to make it more readable, maintainable, and independent. If we worked on this project again, we would start from scratch and take our experience from the first attempt to make the next attempt better.


<h1>Mr. Sushi: A Casual Game for Android</h1>

This is Mr. Sushi, a mobile game for Android devices, made by myself and Nick Horsma in the summer of 2020. While this game was made for a class, we completed it in just one month. I was the principle designer, asset creator, and controls/UI programmer. Nick worked primarily on the sushi spawning code. The game is fully functioning and could easily be published on the App Store in its current state. We are still interested in publishing Mr. Sushi, but currently have no plans to pick it back up.


<h1>SPACE+CTRL: A Typing Game for PC</h1>

SPACE+CTRL was a side project I completed to fulfill an Honors Contract while in an educational/serious game design course in the spring of 2020. I made this project entirely by myself, including sound and asset creation (except for the font!). The idea behind the game is to teach players how to type and to practice typing quickly. While this game is complete in its current state, it doesn't have much content; originally I planned for more stages and difficulties. Instead I opted to include a normal typing test mode separate from the game. I don't currently have plans to continue working on this game, but it is a possibility for the future.
