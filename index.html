<h1>
My name is Sarah Miller, and I'm a game designer & developer with a passion for out-of-the-box thinking and learning new skills.
</h1>

<p>
  While my biggest strengths are in <b>C#</b> and the <b>Unity</b> game engine, I have much more to offer. I've previously worked in languages like <b>C++</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>Python</b>. I can create basic 3D models, rigs, and animations in <b>Maya</b> as well as create 2D graphics in programs like <b>GIMP</b>. I've dabbled in other skills too; feel free to ask about them!
