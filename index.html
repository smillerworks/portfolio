  Are you looking to hire someone who's experienced in C# and Unity for your next project? Look no further! My name is Sarah Miller, and I'm a game designer & developer with a passion for out-of-the-box thinking and learning new skills.

  While my biggest strengths are in C# and the Unity game engine, I have much more to offer. I've previously worked in languages like C++, JavaScript, and Python. I can 3D model, rig, and make basic animations in Maya as well as create 2D graphics in programs like GIMP. I've dabbled in other skills too; feel free to ask about them!
